Translating XiVO
****************

Supported languages are French and English. This means that they are always maintained by
Avencall. Other languages are provided by the community.

We are now using a centralized tool for the XiVO translation. It's Transifex and the web
access is :

* https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/xivo

For the XiVO Client, we have a reference file pushed regularly to Transifex. This file is always by
default in english and translated in Transifex.

New strings to be translated are uploaded to Transifex every release. Translated string are
downloaded from Transifex every release.
