those languages are :

* French : Super Sonic productions (supersonicprod@wanadoo.fr)

* German : ATS studio
* Italian : ATS studio

Prompts transcripts are listed in `Transifex`_ (\*-prompts). You may translate them there.

The prompts used in XiVO are stored in `xivo-sounds`_ git repository. You may also want to

synchronised with the code before every release.
