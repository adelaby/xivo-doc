Queues
******

Call queues are used to distribute calls to the agents subscribed to the queue.  Queues are managed on the
:menuselection:`Services --> Call Center --> Queues` page.

   :menuselection:`Services --> Call Center --> Queues --> Add`

A queue can be configured with the following options:

   * Name : used as an unique id, cannot be ``general``
   * Display name : Displayed on the supervisor screen
   * On-Hold music: The music the caller will hear. The music is played when waiting and when the call is on hold.

A ring strategy defines how queue members are called when a call enters the queue.
A queue can use one of the following ring strategies:

   * Linear: for each call, call the first member, then the second, etc.
   * Least recent: call the member who has least recently hung up a call.
   * Fewest calls: call the member with the fewest completed calls.
   * Round robin memory: call the "next" member after the one who answered.
   * Random: call a member at random
   * Weight random: same as random, but taking the member penalty into account.
   * Ring all: call all members at the same time (*see warning nÂ°2 below*).

   .. warning::

     #. When editing a queue, you can't change the ring strategy to linear. This
        is due to an asterisk limitation. Unfortunately, if you want to change the
        ring strategy of a queue to linear, you'll have to delete and create a new
        queue with the right strategy.

     #. If you use the *Ring all* ring strategy the Contact center statistics are
        not reliable anymore.

  .. note::

      When an agent is a member of many queues. The order of call distribution
      between multiple queues is nondeterministic and cannot be configured.


Timers
======

You may control how long a call will stay in a queue using different timers:

   * Member reachabillity time out (Advanced tab): Maximum number of seconds a call will ring on an agent's phone. If a call is not answered within this time, the call will be forwareded to another agent.
   * Time before retrying a call to a member (Advanced tab) : Used once a call has reached the "Member reachability time out". The call will be put on hold for the number of seconds alloted before being redirected to another agent.
   * Ringing time (Application tab) : The total time the call will stay in the queue
   * Timeout priority (Application tab) : Determines which timeout to use before ending a call. When set to "configuration", the call will use the "Member reachability time out". When set to "dialplan", the call will use the "Ringing time".

No Answer
=========

Call can be diverted on no answer :

.. figure:: noanswer.png
    :scale: 85%

* No answer : The call reach the "Ringing time" in Application tab and no agent has answered the call
* Congestion : The number of calls waiting have reach the "Maximum number of people allowed to wait:" limit of advanced tab
* Fail : No agent was available to answer the call when call entered the queue (join an empty queue condition advanced tab)  or
  the call was queued and no agents was available to answer (Remove callers if there are no agents advanced tab)


Advanced
========

This tab lists the advanced queues options.

* Call a member already on : use this option to call a queue member even if he is already online.

.. warning:: If this option is activated Contact center statistics are not reliable anymore.


Diversions
==========

Diversions can be used to redirect calls towards another destination when a queue is very busy.
Calls are redirected using one of the two following scenarios:

.. figure:: diversions.png
    :scale: 85%


Estimated Wait Time Overrun
---------------------------

When this scenario is used, the administrator can set a destination for calls when the average waiting time is over the threshold.

Waiting Calls / Available Agents Ratio
--------------------------------------

When this scenario is used, the administrator can set a destination when the call ratio is higher than the percent threshold.
The call ratio is calculated with the following formula::

    call ratio = (number of waiting calls / available agents) * 100

Here are a few examples::

    Threshold: 100%
    Waiting calls: 3
    Available agents: 2
    call ratio = (3 / 2) * 100 = 150%
    Calls will be redirected


    Threshold: 120%
    Waiting calls: 9
    Available agents: 12
    call ratio = (9 / 12) * 100 = 75%
    Calls will not be redirected

.. warning::

  With a threshold under 100% and only one agent logged, no call will distributed
  since one waiting call / one agent = 100%
